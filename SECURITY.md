## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/scientistproject/Scientist.net/security/advisories/new) tab.

We will:

- Treat the vulnerability as a security issue rather than a simple bug, both in our response and our disclosure. For example, we will explicitly mention that the issue is a security vulnerability in our release notes.
- Acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report as quickly as possible, even if no immediate resources are available for investigation.
- Involve the vulnerability reporter when we verify the impact and veracity of the report.
- Remediate the issue in a way that we see fit, taking any concerns and advice provided by the vulnerability reporter into careful consideration.
- Always acknowledge the vulnerability reporter when we credit the discovery.
- Aim to publish a fix as soon as we can.
- Ensure that we make the wider ecosystem aware of the issue and its remediation when you disclose the vulnerability.
