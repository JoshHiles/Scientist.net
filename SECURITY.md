## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately.

> The best approach at the moment is to message one of the contributors on https://gitter.im/scientistproject/community privately
> If you dont receive a reply within a couple of days please send the message onto another member

Please do not open issues for anything you think might have a security implication.
